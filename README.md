# Sudoku Solver Application

This is a Sudoku Solver application built using Python and Tkinter. Developed during my software development internship at Prodigy Infotech, this application allows users to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and automatically solve it using the backtracking algorithm. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly graphical interface with a dark theme and neon lights.
